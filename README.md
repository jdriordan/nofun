`nofun` - の糞
====

About
----

Its original purpose of this program was to see how far a minimal almost-brute-force approach could get in Super Mario Bros. for the NES in a reasonable amount of time (see the 0.1 release). The answer is level 4-4.

The scope has since been expanded based on feedback and the author's boundless ambition.

In its current state the program is brutally general. It doesn't rely on any particular game, or even particular system (any emulator supporting `Lua` should do). In essence it's a lua-bash-python glue-ball which records screenshots and input from an emulator run, processes them (this isn't necessary) and uses them to machine-learn to play the game, producing a function which guesses suitable inputs given a screenshot.


Goal
----

The project was inspired by [`tom7`'s `playfun` and `learnfun`][1]. This approach differs in that `playfun` plays like one might imagine a child plays; watching, learning and trying, while `nofun` plays as an actual child plays i.e. holding `B` and `right` and tapping `A` frantically.

The current goal is to get `nofun`  to actually play them games by machine learning from good input (generated by hand, the old brute-force version and maybe even TASes), and hopefully get the machine-learning into such a state that it plays the game better than terribly, finishing `1-1` would be nice. 

The advantage of the current approach over the old one is that `nofun` should be able to play without savestates and memory access, all things going well it may even manage to play in real-time on a console, but that is rather optimistic.

Status
----

`nofun` isn't very good at playing at the moment, but is capable of giving its opinion on suitable inputs given a screenshot. The next step is to pass this back to the emulator so that we can play games again instead of just thinking about them.
